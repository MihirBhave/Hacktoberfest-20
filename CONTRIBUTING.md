Here are some Contributing Guidelines:
--> Only solve the issues don't edit the code simply .
--> Do only what is asked !
--> Dont spam the Pull Requests(PRs).This will make it difficult for the owner to Distinguish between good and bad PRs.

Steps to contribute:

--> First fork the repo you want.
--> Then open the command line or the Terminal clone the repo you want and type : git clone your_url
--> After that, type : cd your_repo
--> To create and checkout a branch type : git checkout -b yourz-branch
--> Make the changes you want and then add the file you made changes to like: git add your_file
--> After all changes are made, commit them by : git commit 
--> Then to push your code just type : git push --set-upstream origin new_con
